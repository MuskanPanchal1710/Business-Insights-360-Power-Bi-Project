# Business Insights 360

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing company, embarked on its first data analytics initiative to gain a competitive edge in the market and embrace data-driven decision-making. This Power BI project was developed to support key stakeholders across various departments—Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain—by providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that help answer critical business questions, identify performance trends, and drive strategic planning across the organization.

# Data Sources

The dashboard integrates data from two main sources:

* **Excel/CSV Files:** Includes targets, market share data, and other related metrics collected from Excel and CSV files.

* **MySQL Database:** Retrieves key fact and dimension tables across all departments to support comprehensive analysis.

# Power BI Skills and Techniques Gained

Throughout this project, I explored a wide range of Power BI features and best practices, gaining hands-on experience in building interactive, dynamic dashboards. Key skills and techniques I learned include:

* Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX language

* Building robust data models with proper relationships and hierarchies

* Implementing bookmarks to toggle between different visuals

* Enabling smooth page navigation using buttons.

* Designing dynamic titles that respond to filters and slicers

* Applying KPI indicators to track performance effectively

* Using conditional formatting with icons or color scales to highlight insights

* Publishing reports to Power BI Service
* Data integration from various sources like Excel/CSV files, MySQL database, etc.
