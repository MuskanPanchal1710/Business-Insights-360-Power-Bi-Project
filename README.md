# Business Insights 360
#Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing company, embarked on its first data analytics initiative to gain a competitive edge in the market and embrace data-driven decision-making. This Power BI project was developed to support key stakeholders across various departments—Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain—by providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports.

The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that help answer critical business questions, identify performance trends, and drive strategic planning across the organization.
