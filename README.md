# 🌐 Business Insights 360

Atliq Hardware is a rapidly growing global company specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories. The company operates through three primary sales channels:

• **Retailers**

• **Direct Sales**

• **Distributors**

As the company expanded, it became evident that decision-making based solely on surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis was no longer sufficient. In contrast, competitors are leveraging advanced analytics teams to drive data-backed strategies and maintain their edge in the market.
Recognizing this gap, Atliq Hardware has committed to building its own Business Intelligence and Analytics capabilities. This strategic move aims to empower the organization with accurate insights and smarter decision-making to ensure long-term sustainability and competitiveness.
The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that help answer critical business questions, identify performance trends, and drive strategic planning across the organization.
