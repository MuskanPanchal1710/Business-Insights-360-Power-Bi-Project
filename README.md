# 🌐 Business Insights 360

Atliq Hardware is a rapidly growing global company specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories. The company operates through three primary sales channels:

• **Retailers**

• **Direct Sales**

• **Distributors**

As the company expanded, it became evident that decision-making based solely on surveys, intuition, and basic Excel analysis was no longer sufficient. In contrast, competitors are leveraging advanced analytics teams to drive data-backed strategies and maintain their edge in the market.
Recognizing this gap, Atliq Hardware has committed to building its own Business Intelligence and Analytics capabilities. This strategic move aims to empower the organization with accurate insights and smarter decision-making to ensure long-term sustainability and competitiveness.
The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations that help answer critical business questions, identify performance trends, and drive strategic planning across the organization.

# 🚀 Project Overview
A Power BI based project designed to provide detailed and interactive insights across core business functions—Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive Management.This Powwr BI dashboard offers a unified platform to visualize and analyze business performance, enabling better decision-making through data-driven insights. Each view is tailored to a specific department to address key performance indicators and operational metrics.

# 📂 Data Sources

The dashboard integrates data from two main sources:

• **Excel/CSV Files:** Includes targets, market share data, and other related metrics collected from Excel and CSV files.

• **MySQL Database:** Retrieves key fact and dimension tables across all departments to support comprehensive analysis.

# 🧠 Power BI Skills and Techniques Gained

Throughout this project, I explored a wide range of Power BI features and best practices, gaining hands-on experience in building interactive, dynamic dashboards. Key skills and techniques I learned include:

• Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX language

• Building robust Data models (Data Modeling)

• Implementing bookmarks to toggle between different visuals

• Enabling smooth page navigation using buttons.

• Designing dynamic titles that respond to filters and slicers

• Applying KPI indicators to track performance effectively

• Using conditional formatting with icons or color scales to highlight insights

• Publishing reports to Power BI Service

# 🧱 Data Modeling Overview   

• In this project, we have implemented the Snowflake Schema data modeling approach, which helps maintain data normalization, enhances query performance, and ensures clarity in relationships between tables.

• Key metrics like forecasts, actuals, expenses, and deductions are captured in separate fact tables.

• Most relationships are one-to-many (*:1) from dimension to fact tables, which ensures efficient filtering and reduces ambiguity in report visuals.
