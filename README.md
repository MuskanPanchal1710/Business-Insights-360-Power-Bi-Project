# Business Insights 360

AtliQ Hardware, a rapidly growing company, embarked on its first data analytics initiative to gain a competitive edge in the market and embrace data-driven decision-making. This Power BI project was developed to support key stakeholders across various departmentsâ€”Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chainâ€”by providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards and reports.
